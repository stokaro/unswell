# PostgreSQL Sequences with Ptah

Ptah supports standalone PostgreSQL sequences as a first-class schema object through the `//ptah:schema:sequence` annotation. A standalone sequence is created with `CREATE SEQUENCE`, altered with `ALTER SEQUENCE`, and dropped with `DROP SEQUENCE`, and participates in the full generate / compare / migrate / rollback lifecycle in the same way as tables, views, functions, and roles.

Standalone sequences are a PostgreSQL feature that Atlas keeps out of its open-source core (it lives only in the proprietary "Pro" build). Ptah provides it as an open (MIT), local, no-account capability — see epic [#654](https://github.com/stokaro/ptah/issues/654).

## Standalone vs. implicit sequences

PostgreSQL creates an *implicit* sequence for every `SERIAL` / `BIGSERIAL` / `SMALLSERIAL` column and for identity columns (`GENERATED ... AS IDENTITY`). Those implicit sequences are owned by their column and are created and dropped automatically with it — you do not declare them.

A *standalone* sequence is one you declare explicitly, typically to share a single number generator across several tables or to control a column default with `DEFAULT nextval(...)`. Ptah's introspection deliberately excludes implicit serial/identity sequences, so declaring a plain `SERIAL` column never produces a spurious standalone-sequence diff.

## Declaring a sequence

```go
package models

//ptah:schema:sequence name="order_number_seq" as="bigint" start="1000" increment="1" cache="20"
type OrderNumberSeq struct{}
```

This renders:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE "order_number_seq" AS bigint INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1000 CACHE 20;
```

### Sequence attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Sequence name (required) |
| `schema` | Target schema/namespace (optional) |
| `as` | Underlying integer type, e.g. `bigint`, `integer`, `smallint` |
| `start` | `START WITH` value |
| `increment` | `INCREMENT BY` value (must be non-zero) |
| `minvalue` | `MINVALUE` bound |
| `maxvalue` | `MAXVALUE` bound |
| `cache` | `CACHE` size |
| `cycle` | `true` to enable `CYCLE` (default `NO CYCLE`) |
| `owned_by` | `table.column` association (`OWNED BY`) |
| `if_not_exists` | Emit `IF NOT EXISTS` |
| `comment` | Optional comment |

Only the options you set are emitted. An option left unset relies on the PostgreSQL default and is never reported as a difference during comparison, so a sequence that uses defaults does not churn against the introspected catalog values.

## Using a sequence as a column default

Because a standalone sequence may back a column default, Ptah always creates sequences before the tables that reference them:

```go
//ptah:schema:sequence name="order_number_seq" start="1000"
type OrderNumberSeq struct{}

//ptah:schema:table name="orders"
type Order struct {
	//ptah:schema:field name="id" type="BIGINT" primary="true" default_expr="nextval('order_number_seq')"
	ID int64
}
```

## Ownership (`OWNED BY`)

`owned_by="table.column"` ties the sequence's lifecycle to a column. Because a sequence referenced by a column default must be created *before* its table, while `OWNED BY` requires the table to already exist, Ptah emits the association as a separate `ALTER SEQUENCE ... OWNED BY` *after* the table is created — the same ordering `pg_dump` uses.

> Note: PostgreSQL cannot distinguish a `SERIAL`-generated sequence from a manually created sequence when both are owned by a column *and* supply that column's default. A sequence in that exact shape is treated as the column's implicit sequence and is not tracked as standalone. A sequence that is merely consumed via `DEFAULT nextval(...)` (without `OWNED BY`), or that carries a lifecycle-only `OWNED BY` (whose owner column does not draw its default from it), is tracked normally.

> Rollback note: changing an existing sequence's `owned_by` and then rolling back restores the previous owner only when the sequence declared an owner before the change; because Ptah manages only declared options, a rollback does not emit `OWNED BY NONE` to detach an ownership that a prior migration added.

## Granting privileges on a sequence

Use `on_sequence` on a `//ptah:schema:grant` annotation. Valid sequence privileges are `USAGE`, `SELECT`, and `UPDATE`:

```go
//ptah:schema:grant role="app_writer" privilege="USAGE,SELECT" on_sequence="order_number_seq"
type AccessControl struct{}
```

See [PostgreSQL Role Management](./POSTGRESQL_ROLES.md) for the full grant model.

## Other dialects

Standalone sequences are enabled for PostgreSQL-family presets with a complete
emit/read/plan path, currently PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, and YugabyteDB. MySQL,
MariaDB, ClickHouse, and Spanner name standalone sequence declarations as
skipped or unsupported in rendered plans. SQLite rejects the change in the
planner. SQL Server has engine-level sequence support, but Ptah does not yet
model standalone SQL Server sequence objects in the portable schema path.
