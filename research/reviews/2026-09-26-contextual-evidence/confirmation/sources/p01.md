A migration that adds a column and backfills it can succeed statement by
statement, match the declaration, and report no drift, while the `UPDATE`
predicate was wrong and a subset of rows kept a null. `ptah schema drift`
compares structure and finds nothing, because the structure is right.

The requirement that would catch it is about the data:

> no row in the set this release covers is left without the new value

`ptah db verify` evaluates requirements like that against a database that is
already running, and changes nothing in it.

## Write the requirements

A requirement is a `-- +ptah check` directive, the same one a migration carries
as a precondition. Put them in a `.sql` file, or a directory of them:

```sql title="release-checks/010_tier_backfill.sql"
-- +ptah check name="every user has a tier" assert="SELECT COUNT(*) = 0 FROM users WHERE tier IS NULL"
-- +ptah check name="no user lost an email" assert="SELECT COUNT(*) = 0 FROM users WHERE email IS NULL"
```

Each `assert` is one read-only `SELECT` returning a single truthy scalar. That
is the same grammar a pre-migration check uses, so versioned migrations and
direct schema changes express a requirement the same way rather than growing
two spellings for one idea.

## Run them

```bash
ptah db verify --db-url "$DATABASE_URL" --checks release-checks/
```

```text title="stdout"
STATUS    NAME                  SOURCE
verified  every user has a tier  release-checks/010_tier_backfill.sql
failed    no user lost an email  release-checks/010_tier_backfill.sql

failed: no user lost an email
  assert: SELECT COUNT(*) = 0 FROM users WHERE email IS NULL

Verdict: failed (1 verified, 1 failed, 0 errored of 2)
```

A directory contributes its `.sql` files in file-name order, and each file its
directives in the order written, so two runs produce lists you can diff. Files
with any other extension are left alone.

Add `--format json` for a machine-readable report with the same four counts and
one entry per assertion.

## What the four outcomes mean

| Outcome | What it says | Exit code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verified` | The assertion ran and held. | `0` when every assertion is verified |
| `failed` | The assertion ran and did not hold. The database answered, and the answer is not the one the author required. | `1` |
| `errored` | The assertion could not run: it is not a well-formed read-only `SELECT`, or the server refused the query. Nothing is established about the requirement. | `2` |
| `not verified` | The run found no assertions at all. | `1` |

`not verified` is deliberately not a pass. A gate that exited `0` over an empty
checks path would let through a release whose requirements someone deleted.

An assertion that could not run outranks one that failed in the verdict line:
a run that never evaluated one of its requirements cannot claim the failures
are the only violations.

## What this verb does not do

It applies no schema, runs no migration, loads no seed data and drops nothing.
That is what separates it from `ptah migrations test` and `ptah schema test`,
whose contract is a throwaway database they may destroy. Point those at a live
database and they would write to it; this verb is meant for the database the
release actually runs on.

What holds it to reading is decided before any query is sent, and then
enforced again while it runs:

- The assertion is a single `SELECT`, proved from its text.
- It names nothing outside the database it is sent to: `dblink`,
  `postgres_fdw`, `INTO OUTFILE`, `LOAD_FILE`, `pg_read_file`, `xp_cmdshell`
  and the rest of that set. No transaction can undo those, because what they
  touch is not in it.
- The session is opened read-only wherever the engine has such a mode.

Both static rules read the assertion under every string-escape interpretation
a server might apply, because the one it applies is session state: under
MySQL's `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES` a string ends at a quote the other reading
swallows, so a clause that looks like data on one reading is live SQL on the
other. A MySQL executable comment is expanded under each interpretation too,
since which characters end a string decides whether the comment is a comment.
The construct list is the one the plan guard applies before a dev database
replays a plan file, kept in one place, so a construct added there is refused
here too.

The read-only session is what catches a shape no reading of the statement can:
on PostgreSQL it refuses a `SELECT` that writes by calling a function that
writes. On Oracle the driver cannot open a read-only transaction, so Ptah asks
the server for one instead, which refuses a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` that would
otherwise hold a row lock every writer waits on. Where an engine has no
read-only mode, the two static rules are the whole of the protection, which is
the guarantee a pre-migration check already carries there.

Each assertion is evaluated in its own session, so one the server refuses
cannot decide the outcome of the next.

## Verify the checks that were approved

`--checks` also takes an `oci://` reference to a schema artifact that publishes
them. `ptah schema push --checks ./release-checks.sql` puts the assertions in a
layer beside the schema — see [Publish a schema to an OCI
registry](../oci-registry/) — and the verify run reads them from there:

```bash
ptah db verify \
  --db-url "$DATABASE_URL" \
  --checks oci://ghcr.io/acme/app-schema@sha256:...
```

A path names whatever is on disk when the run happens. An artifact reference
pinned by digest names one set of bytes, so the assertions a reviewer approved
are the assertions that run — a tag moved afterwards cannot turn a violated
requirement into a clean release. An artifact that publishes no checks layer is
refused rather than reported as a run with nothing to verify: "this artifact
asserts nothing" and "every assertion held" are different answers.

### What it reads

A verification run reads whatever the login it connects with can read. The
promise is that it changes nothing, not that it reads only the connected
database: an assertion may name a view, and a view may already span databases.
On SQL Server a three-part name is ordinary T-SQL, and refusing one would
refuse a correct assertion about a database the same operator owns.

So give `ptah db verify` a login scoped to what the release's requirements are
about, the way you would scope any other credential, and treat a checks file as
code that runs with it — the same standing a migration in the same directory
already has.

### What a read-only session cannot reach

A routine that runs in a transaction of its own is not undone with the session
that called it, on any engine, because it was never part of it. Oracle is where
that is reachable: a function declared `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` may
insert and commit while a `SELECT` calls it, and the row is there afterwards.
An ordinary Oracle function that writes is refused by the server before that
matters — `ORA-14551`, a DML operation inside a query — so the shape that gets
through is one an author wrote deliberately.

So the promise is precise: Ptah sends nothing but a statement it proved is a
read `SELECT`, and opens the strictest session the engine offers. An assertion
that calls a routine to do the reading answers for what that routine does.

## Where this sits beside the other checks

- `ptah schema drift` answers whether the structure matches the declaration.
- `ptah migrations status` answers whether the recorded history matches the
  directory.
- `ptah db verify` answers whether the database holds the result the release
  was for.

The first two are about Ptah's own bookkeeping. This one is about your data,
and only you can write it down.
